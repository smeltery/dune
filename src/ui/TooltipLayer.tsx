/**
 * Every tooltip on screen, drawn over the chrome that asked for one.
 *
 * A sibling of the app's own rows rather than a full-screen box over them: a
 * renderable claims the cells it paints in the hit grid whether or not it
 * handles a mouse event, so a layer spanning the terminal would swallow every
 * click in the editor. These are a few cells each, and they sit beside the
 * control rather than on it, so the pointer is never on one of its own accord.
 *
 * One row apiece, no border and no shadow. A border is drawable, but it costs
 * two rows and two columns per tooltip, and during a peek there may be a dozen
 * of them on a screen that has to stay readable underneath. A shadow is not
 * drawable at all: a terminal cell holds one background, so "dimming what is
 * behind" means painting solid dark cells over the editor, which reads as a
 * smear rather than as depth.
 *
 * What separates a tooltip from the editor is therefore colour alone, and it
 * has to be a pair that cannot fail: `statusBg`/`statusFg` is the one every
 * palette guarantees legible together, and it already means "chrome, not the
 * file" everywhere else it appears. `panelBg` would be wrong here — that is the
 * surface a floating panel is built from, and a tooltip is not a panel.
