/**
 * Code folding, as far as it goes without help from the buffer.
 *
 * OpenTUI's edit buffer has no notion of a hidden line, so a fold is done by
 * handing the textarea a *different text* — the file's lines with the folded
 * ones taken out — and keeping the file's own text beside it. Every line number
 * therefore lives in one of two spaces, and `FoldView` is the translation:
 * `real` indexes the file, `display` indexes what the buffer holds.
 *
 * Regions come from indentation rather than from the grammar, which is what
 * makes them work for languages highlighted with `patterns` and no tree-sitter
 * tree at all. It is also what VS Code falls back to.
