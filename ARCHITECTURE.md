# Architecture

dune is a Solid app rendered to the terminal by [OpenTUI](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui).
OpenTUI supplies the hard parts — layout, the editable text buffer (undo/redo, selection,
grapheme handling), mouse hit-testing and the tree-sitter worker. This repo is the wiring
around it.

```

Dependency direction is one-way: `ui/` and feature folders never import from `app/`.
`App.tsx` owns state and passes it down; components take props and call callbacks.

## Extension points

### Add a language

1. Confirm a grammar wasm exists (most are in the `tree-sitter-wasms` package).
2. Write a highlight query at `src/languages/queries/<id>.scm`, capturing the scopes
   the themes style (`keyword`, `string`, `function`, `type`, `comment`, …).
3. Import both in [`src/languages/grammars.ts`](src/languages/grammars.ts) and add them to
   `GRAMMARS`. The imports have to be static and carry `with { type: 'file' }` — that is
   what makes `bun build --compile` embed them; a path built at runtime resolves to
   nothing inside the shipped binary.
4. Add an entry to `LANGUAGES` in [`src/languages/index.ts`](src/languages/index.ts):

```ts
{ id: 'python', ...GRAMMARS.python }   // id must match OpenTUI's filetype name
```

Grammars OpenTUI already bundles (javascript, typescript, markdown, zig) only need
`bundled: true` — no wasm or query. Parser registration and highlighting both read from
this one table.

The status bar shows the `id`, which is fine for almost all of them. Add a `label` only
where OpenTUI's filetype name is not what a person would call the file — `typescriptreact`
shows as `tsx`, `javascriptreact` as `jsx`.

Highlight queries are easy to get wrong in a way that fails _silently_: a query naming a
node the grammar does not have simply matches nothing, and one invalid pattern stops the
parser from loading at all. Compile a query against its grammar before trusting it, and
assert in `test/languages.test.ts` that a sample really produces highlights.

When no grammar works — tree-sitter-yaml, for one, needs an external scanner OpenTUI's
worker cannot link — declare `patterns` instead: a list of `{ group, re }` painted in
order, later entries winning the characters they overlap. Good enough for line-oriented
config formats, and it needs no wasm.

### Add a theme

Copy an existing theme file and **use a published palette verbatim** — cite the source in
the file header, as the shipped themes do. Change the colors, and register it in `THEMES` in
[`src/themes/index.ts`](src/themes/index.ts). It appears in the command palette
automatically. `ui` covers the chrome; `syntax` maps tree-sitter capture groups to
styles, and sub-scopes fall back to their parent (`type.builtin` → `type`).

Where a published palette maps onto a capture group, follow the scheme's own highlighting
guide too — most upstreams ship one (catppuccin's style guide, everforest's `palette.md`,
solarized's vim colorscheme), and matching it is what makes the theme recognisable. Only
`currentLine` and `indentGuide` are usually absent from a palette; blend them off `bg`
yourself, within the bounds `test/unit.test.ts` and `test/indent.test.tsx` assert.

`setTheme()` **replaces** `syntaxTheme` rather than merging into it. Themes do not all
define the same capture groups, and a leftover group from the previous theme renders in
the wrong palette — near-invisible text when the switch flips light to dark. Sub-scopes
fall back to their parent anyway, so an omitted group costs nothing.

`ui` is a **Solid store**, not a plain object. Solid components never re-render, so a
mutated object would leave every color on screen stale after a theme switch — reading
`ui.bg` inside JSX is what subscribes that spot to the change. `syntaxTheme` can stay a
plain object because it is only read when the style table is rebuilt.

The transparent-background setting is applied in `src/themes/index.ts`, not in individual
palette files, so switching themes preserves transparency without mutating the registered
theme definitions.

Indent guides ride the same pipeline: `computeHighlights` appends one `indent.guide`
capture per indent stop, so they inherit the newline-offset conversion and run-merging
that syntax highlights use.

### Add a setting

Add the field to `Config`, a value to `DEFAULTS`, and validation to `parsePartial()` in
[`src/core/config.ts`](src/core/config.ts). Unknown or malformed values fall back to
defaults, so a hand-edited config can never break startup.

Settings have two layers: the user file at `~/.config/dune/config.json` and optional
project overrides at `<project>/.dune/settings.json`. Startup resolves user values first
and then overlays the project file. `Settings` writes user settings; `Settings: this
project` writes only the local override file.

### Add a command

Add an action to `CommandActions` and an entry to `buildCommands` in
[`src/app/commands.ts`](src/app/commands.ts), then implement the action in `App.tsx`.
For a keybinding, also add a case to the `useKeyboard` handler in `App.tsx` and set the
command's `hint`.

Commands form a tree: an entry either runs (`run`) or opens a submenu (`children`),
never both. Group related commands under a parent to keep the root list short —
typing in the palette searches every leaf across all levels, so nesting never hides
anything. Use the `check()` marker when a submenu reflects current state (themes,
vim mode).

## Things worth knowing

- **Bun only.** OpenTUI's native core loads through Bun's FFI; Node has no FFI.
- **Highlight offsets.** `highlightOnce` returns absolute string offsets, but the edit
  buffer indexes text with newlines removed. `segmentsIn` converts between the two —
  without it, highlights drift right by one column per line above.
- **Key routing.** `useKeyboard` handlers run _before_ the focused textarea, and
  `preventDefault()` hides a key from it — that is how vim normal mode captures keys. Any
  open modal sets `blocked` on the editor so it stops consuming input.
- **Global chords must claim their key.** OpenTUI's textarea has its own Ctrl bindings
  (`Ctrl+W` deletes a word, `Ctrl+F`/`Ctrl+B` move the caret, `Ctrl+←`/`→` jump a word), so
  a chord App handles without `preventDefault()` fires twice — closing a tab used to eat a
  word on the way out. `App.tsx`'s `claim()` wrapper exists for this.
- **`Ctrl+Shift` is not deliverable.** Outside the kitty keyboard protocol
  `Ctrl+Shift+<letter>` arrives byte-identical to `Ctrl+<letter>` with `shift: false`, so a
  shifted chord silently runs the unshifted command. Bindings accept `Ctrl+Opt` as well.
- **Esc is contested.** It leaves vim insert mode and moves focus to the tree. App's
  handler runs first and Solid applies focus synchronously, so it has to check `vimMode()`
  before surrendering the editor — otherwise the vim handler is already unfocused when it
  runs and never sees the key.
- **git paths are resolved.** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the real path
  (`/private/var/…`) while the tree holds what the user opened (`/var/…`), so status keys
  are rebased onto the caller's form before they can be looked up.
- **Gutter is imperative.** `minWidth` and `lineSigns` are constructor arguments or methods
  on `LineNumberRenderable`, not settable props, so `EditorPane` pokes them through a ref.
  Passing them as JSX props silently does nothing, and a fixed width clips line numbers
  once a file passes 99 lines.
- **Global handlers ignore preventDefault.** It stops the focused renderable, not sibling
  `useKeyboard` handlers — those must check `key.defaultPrevented` themselves.
- **Highlights are windowed.** Each `addHighlightByCharRange` is an FFI call, so pushing a
  whole 1500-line file costs ~270ms and repeats on every edit. `EditorPane` applies only
  the viewport plus `OVERSCAN` lines, re-applying when the cursor or a scroll moves the
  window. Segments carry a `line` for exactly this. `applyWindow` therefore has to run
  from the deferred cursor sync too: `↑`/`↓` fire no cursor-change event, so without it
  the window never leaves where the file opened and anything past `OVERSCAN` renders
  unstyled.
- **Highlighting is two stages, and the split is what keeps typing responsive.**
  `computeHighlights` parses (in the tree-sitter worker, off this thread) and returns a
  `Highlighted`; `segmentsIn` turns a _line range_ of it into segments. Segmenting walks
  every character it is given, so doing the whole document cost more than the parse did —
  measured at 5 000 lines: 179ms parse, 152ms segmentation, and only the second number
  blocks. `EditorPane` caches the parse and segments each window once.
- **Everything per-document belongs on `Highlighted`, not in `segmentsIn`.** The line
  offsets and the specificity sort are computed once, at parse time, and this is not a
  micro-optimisation: they are O(characters) and O(captures log n), so recomputing them
  per call put a floor under a _window_ proportional to the whole file. Measured on a
  20 000-line file, segmenting a single line: 2.07ms before, 0.155ms after — and the
  before figure was paid on every scroll tick. `test/perf.test.tsx` guards it as a ratio
  against a whole-document pass, so a slow machine cannot make it pass by accident.
  Adding a per-window `.map()`, `.filter()` or `.sort()` over `ordered` reintroduces it.
- **Incremental parsing is not available for this.** The client does expose
  `createBuffer`/`updateBuffer`, and it is roughly twice as fast — but it reports
  highlights only for the lines the edit _touched_, not the ones it invalidates. Typing
  `/*` at the top of a 400-line file reports one row while a full parse recolours all 400,
  and there is no range-request API to fill the gap. Verified before ruling it out.
- **Async highlight staleness.** Results are only applied if the buffer text still
  matches the snapshot that was highlighted. `computeHighlights` also takes an `isStale`
  probe and answers `STALE` rather than sorting and segmenting work nobody will use.
- **Long lists must be windowed, not just culled.** The Zig core stops handing out
  renderables a few thousand in, and `viewportCulling` skips _drawing_ off-screen
  children while still building them. So a `<For>` over every row is a hard failure,
  not a slow one: `FileTree` left the tree empty when a directory held 8000 entries. It
  renders a window between two spacer boxes, so the scrollbox's extent and mouse wheel
  still work. Do not "simplify" it back to rendering the whole list, and size the window
  from the terminal rather than with a constant — a fixed 200 rows left the bottom of the
  tree blank on a tall screen.
- **The editor scrollbar is ours; the sidebar's is OpenTUI's.** `FileTree` sits in a
  `<scrollbox>` with a real draggable scrollbar. The editor paints its own track, and
  dragging it cannot assign `editor.scrollY` — that is read-only at runtime, and moving
  the caret instead would retarget the cursor. The drag therefore synthesizes the one
  input the buffer accepts, a wheel event whose `delta` is in rows, aimed at
  coordinates inside the textarea so `ignoreScrollOutsideBounds` does not drop it.
- **Single-file mode is a different entry state, not a mode flag.** `dune file.ts` passes
  `openFile` to `App`, which then builds its initial state from that one file instead of
  from `loadSession` — one tab, no expanded folders, sidebar hidden — and skips
  `saveSession` entirely. Skipping the write is the part worth keeping: the folder's own
  layout is not this invocation's to overwrite with a one-tab, no-sidebar session. Nothing
  else in the app branches on it; `Ctrl+B`, the tree, search and git all work normally
  because `rootDir` is still a real directory.
- **One move function, because a folder move invalidates paths in bulk.** `movePath` in
  `App.tsx` backs renaming and `x`/`p` alike: it renames on disk and then
  remaps every tab, buffer, preview and expanded entry _at or under_ the old path. A
  buffer left pointing at the old path saves the file back to where it used to be,
  recreating the folder that was just moved. Anything that relocates a path goes through
  here.
- **A one-column drag target needs capture on its parent.** Both draggable edges — the
  editor's scrollbar and the sidebar's divider — are one column wide, and a pointer
  leaves that within the first few rows of a vertical drag. Each event goes to whatever
  sits under the pointer, so the `onMouseDrag` handler lives on the enclosing row and a
  `dragging`/`resizing` signal, set on mouse-down over the handle, decides whether to
  act. Binding the drag to the handle itself makes the gesture die on the first stray
  pixel, which reads as a stuck scrollbar.
- **The watcher ignores `.git`, with two deliberate exceptions.** Reading git status
  rewrites `.git/index`, so a recursive watch that reacted to it would feed itself
  forever: status → index write → watcher → status. But a commit or checkout made in
  another terminal touches no working-tree file, and macOS coalesces everything under
  `.git` down to `.git/index.lock` — the very file to avoid. So `watchTree` adds separate
  watchers on `.git/HEAD` and `.git/refs`, which report a commit, checkout, reset or
  pack-refs and (verified) nothing that reading status does. The callback is told which
  kind of change a burst held, because reacting costs different amounts: re-reading
  ahead/behind is two subprocesses and only history moving can change it, so a plain save
  must not trigger it.
- **Unsupported files are refused at the door, not hidden.** `listDir` returns everything
  a directory holds, so the filesystem layer tells the truth; `openFile` is the only
  content guard, and it opens no tab for anything `readFile` rejects. The visible tree may
  opt into hiding dotfiles or gitignored rows through config, but those filters sit above
  `listDir` in `treeVisibility.ts`, so file pickers, search, and direct opens still have a
  filesystem-level source of truth. The single unconditional exception is `VCS_DIRS`: a
  `.git` store is not project content and would swamp the tree, the fuzzy picker and
  project search.
- **git mutations run async, queries run sync.** `core/git.ts` queries (`diff` for the
  gutter marks, `status` for the tree marks, `rev-parse`/`rev-list` for the branch and
  ahead/behind) sit behind UI that renders every frame, so they use `spawnSync`. Commit,
  push, pull, fetch, stash and branch actions go through `mutate()`, which uses async
  `spawn` instead — a slow `push` must not freeze the terminal. A mutation can rewrite a
  file a buffer still has open; the mtime check under "Conflicts" below is what catches
  that, not any read-only boundary on this file.
- **git output is not capped at 1 MB.** `spawnSync` truncates there by default and
  reports ENOBUFS, which every caller in `core/git.ts` reads as "no output" — `status` in a
  repository with thousands of changed files would silently become "nothing changed" and
  the tree would show no marks. The helper raises `maxBuffer`.
- **Destroyed natives outlive the ref.** Closing the last tab swaps the textarea for the
  placeholder and destroys the native buffer while `editor` still points at it. Both
  pending timers touch it, so they are cleared from the ref's own `onCleanup` — the pane's
  `onCleanup` fires far too late and the timer throws from outside any handler.
- **Network.** Besides one best-effort npm registry lookup at startup to check for a
  newer version (2.5s timeout, failures ignored, disabled by `checkUpdates: false`), the
  only network traffic is push/pull/fetch, run through `mutate()`. Those set
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT: '0'` so a missing credential fails the command instead of opening
  `/dev/tty` behind the alt-screen and freezing the single render thread — the query side
  in this file still runs no command that talks to a remote.
- **Session restore.** Tabs and their buffers are seeded synchronously in the component
  body, not in an effect — mounting the editor before its buffer exists renders an empty
  document and marks the file modified.
- **Focused colors.** Inputs and the editor render focused, and OpenTUI then uses the
  `focused*` colors — setting only `textColor` leaves text in the renderable's default,
  which is invisible on most themes. `ui/TextInput.tsx` exists so no panel forgets.
- **Focus is synchronous.** Solid applies state during the keypress, so a key that moves
  focus into the editor also reaches the textarea unless the handler calls
  `preventDefault()`.
- **Conflicts.** Each buffer records the disk mtime it was last in sync with; saving over
  a file that changed underneath prompts instead of clobbering.
